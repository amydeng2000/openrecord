/**
 * Run a passkey login, recovering from WebAuthn signature-counter desync.
 *
 * MyChart enforces a strictly-increasing signature counter on each passkey
 * assertion. Our locally-stored counter can fall behind the server's — a prior
 * login advanced the server but the bumped value was never persisted (e.g. the
 * login was treated as failed, or the process exited first), or the same
 * passkey was used from another device. When that happens the first assertion
 * is rejected because its counter is too low, and the previous CLI behaviour
 * was to give up immediately.
 *
 * Here we treat an `invalid_login` as a possible counter mismatch: bump the
 * counter and retry, up to `maxBumps` times. `attempt` is expected to run the
 * real login (which increments `credential.signCount` while building the
 * assertion), so on success `credential.signCount` holds the value the server
 * accepted and the caller can persist it. Non-counter outcomes (`logged_in`,
 * `need_2fa`, `error`) return immediately — bumping wouldn't help those.
 *
 * `credential` is mutated in place (its `signCount` is advanced); callers
 * should persist it after a successful return.
