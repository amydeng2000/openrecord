# MyChart Scrapers - Memory

## eUnity Image Viewer Protocol (Reverse-Engineered 2026-03-03)

See `scrapers/myChart/eunity/docs/EUNITY_PROTOCOL.md` for full details.

**Direct HTTP download pipeline works end-to-end** (no Playwright needed):
1. SAML chain → JSESSIONID
2. AMF `getStudyListMeta` → code=0, study metadata with all series/instance UIDs
3. `CustomImageServlet` CLOWRAPPER → 6+ MB CLO image data

Key AMF protocol details (verified by byte-for-byte match with captured browser traffic):
- `AmfServicesMessage` sealed members: `messageID`, `messageType`, `body` (order matters!)
- `AmfServicesRequest` sealed members: `service`, `method`, `parameters` (NOT `args`)
- Parameter is `StudyListRequest` Externalizable object (NOT a string array)
- patientId format: `<MRN>$$$<SITE>` (triple dollar signs)
- AMF3Writer needs string reference table for correct encoding

Key endpoints on the eUnity server:
- **`POST /e/AmfServicesServlet`** — AMF binary protocol for study metadata (series/instance UIDs)
- **`POST /e/CustomImageServlet`** — Image data (`CLOWRAPPER` or `CLOPIXEL`)
- Response format: `CLOHEADERZ01` magic + zstd-compressed Haar wavelet data
- Auth: JSESSIONID cookie from SAML chain; CLOAccessKeyID tokens are single-use, expire in ~1-2 min
- `node-fetch` fails at the SAML selfauth endpoint (TLS fingerprinting) — use `globalThis.fetch`

## Cookie Serialization Bug (Fixed 2026-03-03)

`MyChartRequest.serialize()` was sync but `cookieJar.serialize()` is async → serialized a Promise, not cookies. Fixed by making `serialize()` async + `await` at all call sites (cli.ts, storage.ts, web app).

## MyChart Messaging API (Reverse-Engineered)

See [mychart-messaging-api.md](mychart-messaging-api.md) for full details.

Key points:
- New messages use `/api/medicaladvicerequests/` endpoints (NOT `/api/conversations/`)
- Replies use `/api/conversations/SendReply`
- `messageBody` is an **array of strings**, not a plain string
- All API calls need `__RequestVerificationToken` header from `/app/communication-center` HTML
- WP-encoded IDs used throughout (e.g. `WP-24...`)

## MyChart Session Keepalive (Reverse-Engineered 2026-03-06)

MyChart has TWO separate timeout mechanisms:

**Server-side session**: Kept alive by calling `/Home/KeepAlive?cnt=N` and `/keepalive.asp?cnt=N` every 30s (both return "1" if alive, "0" if expired). These are the actual endpoints that reset the server session timer. Pinging `/Home` does NOT extend the session — it just serves the page.

**Client-side inactivity timer**: JavaScript `checkActivity()` tracks `$$WPUtil.setActivity.__lastActivity`. Shows a "Your session is expiring" popup at 19 min (`refreshTimeout=1140000ms`), force-logs out at 20 min (`sessionTimeout=1200000ms`). Only reset by user interaction (mouse/keyboard) or clicking "Stay logged in" (which calls `$$WPUtil.setActivity()`). The keepAlive pings do NOT reset this timer.

For our scraper: only the server-side keepalive matters. The client-side timer is browser JS only. Fixed in PR #59 — sessionStore now calls both `/Home/KeepAlive` and `/keepalive.asp` every 30s.

The globalThis singleton pattern is required for the sessionStore in Next.js — each API route is bundled separately, so module-level singletons create separate instances. See `scrapers/myChart/sessionStore.ts`.

## Playwright Virtual Authenticator for Passkey Login

Playwright can use CDP virtual authenticators to log in with saved software passkeys automatically — no 2FA needed:

```typescript
const cdpSession = await page.context().newCDPSession(page);
await cdpSession.send('WebAuthn.enable');
const { authenticatorId } = await cdpSession.send('WebAuthn.addVirtualAuthenticator', {
  options: { protocol: 'ctap2', transport: 'internal', hasResidentKey: true, hasUserVerification: true, isUserVerified: true }
});
// Add saved credential from .passkey-credentials/<hostname>.json
await cdpSession.send('WebAuthn.addCredential', {
  authenticatorId,
  credential: { credentialId, rpId, privateKey, userHandle, signCount, isResidentCredential: true }
});
```

Private key format: CDP expects raw PKCS8 bytes as base64, which is exactly what's stored in the credential file. Then click "Log in with passkey" and the virtual authenticator handles everything.

## eUnity Image Download — Each Image Has Its Own SeriesUID (Discovered 2026-04-05)

The AMF parser may report multiple instanceUIDs under the "same" seriesUID, but the real eUnity viewer treats each (seriesUID, objectUID) pair as a separate image request. Network capture shows:
- 3 separate CLOWRAPPER requests with 3 **different** seriesUIDs, each with `frameNumber=1`
- Requesting the same seriesUID with different objectUIDs returns 217-byte errors
- `level` parameter varies per series (0, 3, 4) — not just per progressive refinement

The scraper must use each entry's own seriesUID + instanceUID as-is from the AMF parse, not group by seriesUID.

## Passkey Challenge Encoding (Fixed 2026-04-05)

WebAuthn spec requires the `challenge` field in `clientDataJSON` to be **base64url** encoded, not standard base64. The MyChart server sends the challenge as standard base64. Must convert: `Buffer.from(challenge, 'base64').toString('base64url')` before building clientDataJSON.

## CLO Sign Encoding — Zigzag is Correct (2026-04-06)

Attempted two's complement decoding based on eUnity's GPU shader code (`unpackedValueFromSignedShort`), but it produced WORSE results (visible checkerboard/tile artifacts). The shader's two's complement is for the final pixel display stage, NOT wavelet coefficient decoding. Zigzag is correct.

## MRI Downloads Work (2026-04-06)

MRI was previously skipped in the CLI (`nameLower.includes('mri')` check). Removed the skip — the eUnity pipeline is modality-agnostic (same CLO format for X-ray, CT, MRI). Successfully tested MRI downloads with multi-series studies.

## Signup / Account Recovery (Onboarding §7)

See [mychart-signup-recovery-api.md](mychart-signup-recovery-api.md) for the live Denver Health (Epic) contract. Scrapers: `scrapers/myChart/signup.ts` (self-signup + activation code) and `accountRecovery.ts` (unified forgot username/password), bootstrapped via `preAuthRequest.ts` (`createPreAuthRequest` — resolves firstPathPart for pre-login flows; `determineFirstPathPart` is now exported from login.ts). Expo wiring: `expo-app/src/lib/scrapers/onboarding-auth.ts` + onboarding steps `account-choice-step`/`activate-step`/`signup-step`/`recover-step`. **Key constraint: real Epic self-signup is gated by reCAPTCHA Enterprise — pure HTTP can't mint the token; production needs a WebView. fake-mychart has no bot protection.**

## Project Patterns
- Scrapers follow pattern: export async function that takes `MyChartRequest`, returns typed data
- `MyChartRequest` handles cookies, headers, redirects via `makeRequest(config)`
- CLI at `cli/cli.ts` with `--host`, `--user`, `--pass`, `--2fa`, `--action` args
- Primary test target is the MyChart instance configured in creds.json

## Monorepo Structure (Refactored 2026-03-04)
- `scrapers/` — shared scraper code (myChart)
- `cli/` — CLI entry point + resend 2FA
- `shared/` — common types (AccountStatus, CommonMyChartAccount)
- `read-local-passwords/` — browser keystore extraction
- `scrapers/myChart/clo-image-parser/` — eUnity CLO image parser
- `web/` — Next.js web app (still has its own scraper copies in `web/src/lib/mychart/`)
- Tests: `bun test scrapers/myChart/__tests__/*.test.ts` (132 unit) + `cd web && bun test` (295 web)
- Node 25 + ESLint crashes (SIGABRT) — pre-existing issue, not refactor-related
